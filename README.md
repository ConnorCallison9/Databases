Database System Project Overview

Course: Advanced Databases  
Project Score: 79%

Team Composition:
Total Members: 5 (including myself)

Project Background:
Top G Clinic is a well-established medical facility specializing in primary care services. The clinic's management identified inefficiencies and errors in their current manual system, 
leading to delays in patient care and billing. Consequently, the management decided to implement a new database system to enhance operational efficiency and patient care.

Project Objectives:
The primary goal of the new database system is to:
- Improve Patient Care: By storing and managing comprehensive patient health records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and medications. Real-time access to this data will facilitate informed decision-making by physicians and medical staff.
- Streamline Operations: By automating critical tasks such as appointment scheduling, patient information management, and billing. This will reduce manual errors and delays.
- Enhance Revenue Management: By optimizing billing and collections processes, including insurance claims, payment processing, and collections.
- Ensure Compliance: By adhering to government regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA, to protect patient data privacy and security.
- Generate Reports: Capable of producing on-demand reports related to patient outcomes, revenue, and other key performance indicators.

Project Scope:**
Our team was responsible for developing both the logical and physical designs of the database system for Top G Clinic. Our deliverables included:
- Logical Design: Structuring the database to reflect the clinicâ€™s operations and data requirements.
- Normalization: Ensuring the database design reduces redundancy and improves data integrity.
- Oracle Implementation: Utilizing Oracle Database to implement the design.
- System Views: Creating views to facilitate data access and reporting.
- Schema and SQL Code: Designing the schema and generating SQL code to define and manipulate the database structure.

This project aimed to create a robust and efficient database system to support the clinic's operational goals and enhance overall patient care.
