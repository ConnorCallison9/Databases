Top G Clinic is an established medical facility that specializes in providing primary care services. The clinic's management team has recently conducted an initial study on the use of a database 
system to manage patient information, scheduling appointments, and billing processes. The study has revealed that the current manual system is inefficient and prone to errors, resulting in delays 
in patient care and billing. As a result, the clinic's management team has decided to acquire a database system to streamline operations and improve patient care. 

The objective of the new database system for Top G clinic is to improve patient care by storing and managing patient health records, diagnoses, treatment plans, and medications. Real-time access to 
patient data will enable physicians and medical staff to make informed decisions about patient care. The new system should also streamline operations by automating tasks such as appointment scheduling, 
patient information management, and billing, reducing manual errors and delays. Additionally, the new database system should aim to increase revenue by improving billing and collections processes, such 
as insurance claims, payment processing, and collections. Compliance with government regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA, is also a critical objective to ensure patient data privacy and 
security. Overall, the new database system should support the clinic's goals of providing high-quality patient care, improving operational efficiency, and maintaining compliance. Reports on request should 
be able to generate patient outcomes, revenue, and other key performance indicators.

We where tasked with building the Locigal and Physical design of this medical faciliy. 

In this project we built the logical design, Normalisation, Oracal as well as System Views and the Schema generated with SQL code plan.
